# gmail_stats

Google AppScripts that counts how many e-mails you received from each recepient.

## Context

- Like many other my inbox is full, with dozeon of thousands of mails
- most of them: I don't need them
- How do I filter the ones I don't need the most ?

## Proposal

I decided to write some basic AppScript that check every e-mail and
record how many mail received from each unique recipient.

From there I can see which recipient sent me most emails and then start digging from
there filtering first on the recipient, then on finer filter if needed.

## Example

- received > 1000 mails from some online magazines
- it was 10 years ago
- the mail contains only the headlines of the new magazin
- all of them can be removed.
